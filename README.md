ShoppingBasket Test Design Kata
===============================

This repo has a solution to the [Shopping Basket Kata](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/shopping_basket.html). In the starting position, there are four tests for the same functionality. They all successfully run. However, if there were a bug in the implementation they would give different feedback. Add such a bug and compare how useful the error messages are. 

Remove the bug and refactor the tests to follow accepted design patterns and make full use of the capabilities of the test framework you are using. Then re-introduce the bug and make sure the feedback is better than before.
